1. Service Class Extraction
Why: The original renderScene method was cluttered with various responsibilities, including camera setup, scene configuration, image buffer initialization, and more. This not only made the method lengthy and complex but also tightly coupled with the details of various classes like Camera, SceneCamera, and image handling.

How it helps: Extracting these responsibilities into dedicated service classes (CameraService and RenderSetupService) allows each part of the process to be encapsulated within its appropriate context. This means that each service class focuses solely on a specific aspect of the rendering setup, making them easier to manage and evolve. For example, any changes required in camera preparation are now isolated within CameraService, without affecting other parts of the system.

2. Delegating Responsibilities to Services
Why: The original method directly manipulated the properties and state of external objects like Camera and image buffers. This is a clear indication of Feature Envy, where a function is more interested in the data of other objects than its own.

How it helps: By delegating the responsibility for camera setup to CameraService and image preparation to RenderSetupService, the method reduces its dependencies on external data. This aligns with good object-oriented design by promoting information hiding and ensuring that data manipulation is handled by the objects that own the data.

3. Initialization and Dependency Injection
Why: The method initially created and manipulated many objects directly, which led to high coupling and low cohesion. This makes the code difficult to test and maintain.

How it helps: Using constructor injection or method parameters to pass dependencies, such as camera and image setup utilities, enhances the modularity and testability of the code. It clearly defines what dependencies the class requires and makes unit testing easier by allowing mock implementations of these dependencies to be injected in tests.

4. Reduction of Synchronization Scope
Why: The original method was defined as synchronized, which could lead to performance bottlenecks if the method does extensive processing and is accessed by multiple threads.

How it helps: In the refactored code, the focus is on minimizing the scope of critical sections, potentially moving synchronization closer to just the resources that truly need thread safety. This approach would reduce contention and improve performance. (Note: actual synchronization implementation details depend on subsequent specific requirements and are not explicitly shown in the refactor.)

5. Improved Readability and Maintainability
Why: Handling multiple tasks such as setting camera parameters, initializing rendering components, and starting rendering threads in one method makes it cumbersome and error-prone.

How it helps: The refactored approach using a RenderManager orchestrates the rendering process by coordinating with the service classes. This clear separation of duties enhances readability—making the system easier to understand—and maintainability, allowing for easier modifications and extensions.
