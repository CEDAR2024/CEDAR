1. **Creation of `MetricsUpdater`, `HFileMetrics`, and `HLogMetrics` classes:** The original method `doUpdates` was responsible for updating various metrics that belonged to different areas of the system. This was a clear indication of Feature Envy, as the method was overly interested in the data of other classes (`HFile` and `HLog`). To address this, separate classes were created to handle the metrics of different parts of the system. This allows each class to focus on a specific area, reducing the dependency on data from other classes.

2. **Moving logic to the new classes:** The logic for updating metrics was moved to the new classes. For example, the `HFileMetrics` class now handles the metrics for `HFile`, and the `HLogMetrics` class handles the metrics for `HLog`. This ensures that each class is only concerned with its own data, eliminating the Feature Envy smell.

3. **Creation of `doUpdates` methods in the new classes:** These methods encapsulate the logic for updating the metrics in their respective classes. This enhances encapsulation and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

4. **Changes in the main `doUpdates` method:** The main `doUpdates` method now only creates instances of the new classes and calls their `doUpdates` methods. This makes the main method much simpler and more readable. It also enhances the Single Responsibility Principle, as each method is now responsible for one specific task.

By making these changes, the Feature Envy smell is eliminated, as each method now only accesses data from its own class. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, and it also reduces the risk of bugs, as each class is now responsible for its own data and behavior.
