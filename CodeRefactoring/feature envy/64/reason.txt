The original `renderTriangleGouraud` method exhibited the code smell of "Long Method," where a method does more than one thing and becomes overly complex. The refactoring introduced above addresses this by applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and breaking down the method into smaller, more focused methods. Here's how each change helps address the code smell:

1. **Extracting `sortVerticesByY` Method**: 
   - **Why**: The original method started by sorting the vertices by their `y` coordinate, which is a distinct logical step.
   - **Benefit**: By extracting this logic into its own method, we separate the concerns, making the code easier to understand and test in isolation.

2. **Creating `TriangleVertex` Class**:
   - **Why**: The original method had a large number of parameters related to the properties of vertices. Grouping these into a class simplifies parameter passing and improves code readability.
   - **Benefit**: Encapsulating vertex data reduces the cognitive load when understanding how vertices are manipulated throughout the rendering process.

3. **Extracting `calculateIntermediateVariables` Method**:
   - **Why**: The original method had a significant portion of code dedicated to setting up variables for the rasterization process.
   - **Benefit**: Isolating this setup allows us to separate the initialization from the core logic of rasterization, making both sections clearer and easier to maintain.

4. **Extracting `rasterizeTriangle` and `rasterizeHalfTriangle` Methods**:
   - **Why**: The rasterization process was intermingled with variable setup and vertex sorting. This part of the code can be logically grouped into a process that deals with the actual pixel-by-pixel rendering.
   - **Benefit**: These methods now clearly define the steps of rasterization. By splitting the rasterization into top and bottom halves, we can reuse the same logic for both parts, thus following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

5. **Better Parameter Management**:
   - **Why**: The original method had an overwhelming number of parameters, which made it difficult to track the use and flow of data.
   - **Benefit**: By bundling related parameters into objects (like `TriangleVertex`) and passing these to the new methods, we reduce the method signatures' complexity. This makes the code more manageable and the methods' purposes more apparent.

In summary, the refactoring addresses the code smell by decomposing a large, complex method into smaller methods, each with a single responsibility. This not only makes the code more readable and maintainable but also facilitates easier testing and debugging, as each piece of functionality can now be considered in isolation.
