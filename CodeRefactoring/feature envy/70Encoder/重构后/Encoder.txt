The refactoring process involved several changes to address the Feature Envy code smell and improve the overall design of the code. Here's a breakdown of the changes and how they help:

1. **Extracting the QRCodeEncoder class:**
    - **Why:** The original `encode` method was performing multiple tasks that operated on the data of the `QRCode` class. By introducing the `QRCodeEncoder` class, we give a dedicated context where it makes sense to interact with the `QRCode`'s data.
    - **Benefit:** This change adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), ensuring that the `QRCodeEncoder` class has one reason to change, which is handling the QR code encoding process. It also moves methods closer to the data they operate on, reducing Feature Envy.

2. **Encapsulating the encoding process:**
    - **Why:** The encoding steps were all placed within a single method, making it difficult to understand and maintain.
    - **Benefit:** By breaking down the process into smaller methods within the `QRCodeEncoder` class (`encodeContent`, `appendECIIfApplicable`, `validateQRCode`, etc.), the code becomes more modular and each part can be understood, tested, and maintained independently.

3. **Passing the necessary context via the constructor:**
    - **Why:** The original method had to access various pieces of data like `encoding`, `mode`, and `dataBits` across different steps.
    - **Benefit:** By initializing the `QRCodeEncoder` with this data, we ensure that each method has access to the necessary context without relying on external data, thus reducing dependencies and improving cohesion.

4. **Method extraction for specific tasks:**
    - **Why:** The original method contained logic for appending ECI, validating the QR code, and other tasks mixed together.
    - **Benefit:** Methods like `appendECIIfApplicable` and `validateQRCode` encapsulate specific behavior, making the code easier to read and understand. This also makes the code more reusable and testable.

5. **Maintaining a clear entry point:**
    - **Why:** Despite the refactoring, we kept a static `encode` method as the entry point.
    - **Benefit:** This maintains the API's usability, so that clients of the code don't have to know about the internal `QRCodeEncoder` class, preserving encapsulation.

Each of these changes aims to create a more maintainable, readable, and cohesive codebase. By ensuring that methods operate on the data within their own class and reducing the interdependencies between classes, the Feature Envy smell is significantly reduced. This leads to a codebase that is easier to extend and less prone to bugs, as changes in one part of the system are less likely to inadvertently affect others.
