The original code has a Feature Envy smell because the `processFormSubmission` method in the Controller class is overly interested in the data of the `InTrayCommand` class. It's performing a lot of operations on the `InTrayCommand` object and it's directly accessing its fields.

To address this, I created a new class `InTrayCommandManager` that encapsulates the operations on the `InTrayCommand` object. This class takes an `InTrayCommand` object and a page size as arguments in its constructor, and provides a `processAction` method that performs the necessary action based on the command's action type. This method replaces the large switch statement in the original `processFormSubmission` method.

This change reduces the Feature Envy smell by moving the operations that are envious of the `InTrayCommand` class into a class that is more naturally responsible for these operations. It also improves the readability and maintainability of the code by reducing the complexity of the `processFormSubmission` method and by encapsulating the operations on the `InTrayCommand` object within the `InTrayCommandManager` class.

In addition, this refactoring makes the code more extensible. If new actions need to be added in the future, they can be added as new methods in the `InTrayCommandManager` class, without having to modify the `processFormSubmission` method. This adheres to the Open-Closed Principle, which states that software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
