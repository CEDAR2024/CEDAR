The original code suffered from the "Feature Envy" code smell because the method `doUpdates` in the class was excessively interacting with data from other classes and objects. This can be problematic as it tightly couples the class to the external data it is using, making the code harder to maintain and update. 

To address this issue, the code was refactored as follows:

1. A new class `MetricsUpdater` was created. This class is responsible for updating the metrics, which was previously done in the `doUpdates` method. This change adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, which states that a class should have only one reason to change. Here, the `MetricsUpdater` class is only responsible for updating the metrics.

2. The `doUpdates` method was moved to the `MetricsUpdater` class and renamed to `updateMetrics`. This method is now responsible for coordinating the update of metrics.

3. The `updateMetrics` method was further broken down into smaller helper methods each responsible for a specific task (`resetMetrics`, `pushMetrics`, `addHLogAndHFileMetrics`, `pushLatencyMetrics`). This improves the readability of the code and makes it easier to maintain and debug.

4. In the original class, a new instance of `MetricsUpdater` is created and the `updateMetrics` method is called. This reduces the responsibilities of the original class and delegates the task of updating the metrics to the `MetricsUpdater` class.

These changes help to address the "Feature Envy" code smell by reducing the dependency of the original class on external data. The responsibilities are now more clearly divided between classes, improving the maintainability and readability of the code.
