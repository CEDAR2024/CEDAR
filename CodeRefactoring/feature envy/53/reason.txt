1. Introduction of Service Classes
Why: The original processOther method was deeply involved in the logic pertaining to handling seeds, directly manipulating the data and state of Seed objects and TargetEditorContext. This close coupling between data handling and business logic in a controller method leads to a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and shows signs of Feature Envy, as the method is overly concerned with the data of other objects.

How it helps: By introducing the SeedService class, we encapsulate all seed-related operations within a service dedicated to managing Seed objects. This approach aligns with the SRP, as the service now becomes the only part of the code responsible for handling the business logic associated with seeds. It reduces the controller's dependency on the internal details of seed management, thus addressing the Feature Envy smell by making the processOther method more focused on handling the request-response flow rather than the data manipulation logic.

2. Centralized Error and Context Management
Why: The original method was handling multiple responsibilities including error handling, context management, and transitions between tabs in addition to processing commands. This multifunctionality complicated the method, making it susceptible to changes in unrelated system parts.

How it helps: By continuing to utilize methods like preProcessNextTab and potentially introducing error handling and context management functionalities within either the controller or dedicated helper classes, the code's organization improves, focusing each part on a well-defined role. Error handling can also be encapsulated in a service or utility class, further simplifying the main controller logic and making it easier to update or maintain.

3. Reduction in Direct Data Manipulation
Why: Directly accessing and modifying data from TargetEditorContext and Seed objects within the controller method leads to tightly coupled code, where changes in the data model could necessitate changes in the controller.

How it helps: The SeedService takes over the responsibility of manipulating Seed objects. This means the controller does not need to know the details of how seeds are processed, added, or removed. This decoupling allows for easier modifications in the handling of seeds without affecting the controller logic, focusing changes only where they are necessary.

4. Switch Statement for Command Action Handling
Why: Handling different actions within a single method without clear separation can lead to complex and hard-to-follow code, especially as more actions are added over time.

How it helps: Using a switch statement (or a similar conditional structure) within the processOther method to delegate to the SeedService based on the action type organizes the code better. It clarifies what actions are possible and how they are processed. Each case in the switch statement acts as a clear entry point for a specific command action, improving readability and maintainability.
