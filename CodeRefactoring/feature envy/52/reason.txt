
1. Separation into Controller Methods
Why: The original method was overly complex and handled multiple responsibilities, ranging from session management to business logic processing. This complexity made the method hard to maintain and susceptible to changes in unrelated areas of the application.

How it helps: By breaking down the handle method into handleTreeLoading, processCommand, and buildModelAndView, each method focuses on a specific aspect of the request. This separation makes the code easier to read and modify. For example, if changes are needed in how trees are loaded, this can be done in handleTreeLoading without affecting how commands are processed or how the model and view are built.

2. Introduction of a Service Layer
Why: The original controller had direct dependencies on numerous details of the data model and performed complex operations directly related to the business logic, such as file processing and tree management.

How it helps: Implementing services like TreeService, FileService, and SessionService encapsulates specific functionalities, making the system more modular. Each service can focus on a particular domain of logic (like tree manipulation or file handling), reducing the dependencies within the controller on the inner workings of these processes. This helps in isolating changes to the service layer, reducing the impact on other parts of the application.

3. Use of DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
Why: Not explicitly mentioned in the refactored code snippet, but implied through the handling of simplified commands and session attributes, using DTOs or similar structures would help pass data cleanly between methods and services without exposing complex business models or requiring extensive parameter lists.

How it helps: DTOs simplify method signatures by encapsulating data in single objects. This prevents methods from having to "envy" or pull in multiple pieces of data from different parts of the system, aligning with the goal of reducing Feature Envy. They streamline the interaction between the controller and services, and between services themselves, focusing interactions on necessary data only.

4. Improving Readability and Maintainability
Why: The original method was lengthy and handled multiple types of operations which made it difficult to trace the flow of data and understand the impact of changes.

How it helps: The refactoring makes each component smaller and focused on a single task. This improves readability as developers can quickly understand what each part of the code is doing. It also enhances maintainability because changes in one aspect of functionality (like tree management) are less likely to require changes in unrelated parts (like file handling).

5. Enhanced Testability
Why: Testing a large method that handles many aspects of application logic is cumbersome and prone to errors. It often requires setting up a complex environment where changes in one part can unexpectedly affect others.

How it helps: With a clear separation of concerns and encapsulation of business logic in services, unit testing becomes more straightforward. Each service can be mocked or stubbed independently in tests for the controller, allowing for more focused and reliable tests. Similarly, services themselves can be tested in isolation, ensuring that each component functions correctly independent of others.
