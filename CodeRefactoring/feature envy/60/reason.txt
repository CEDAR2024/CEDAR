The initial code has a method that is doing too much. It's calculating the positions of the vertices of the triangle, assigning colors, and rendering the triangle all within one function. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code harder to read, understand, and maintain. 

The code smell we're addressing here is Feature Envy. The method `renderFlatTriangle` is dealing with too many details that could be better organized into a separate class. The operations related to rendering the triangle are not the responsibility of the method itself but are rather characteristics of the triangle that's being rendered.

To address this, we create a new class `TriangleRenderer`. This class encapsulates the details of how to render a triangle, which simplifies the original method and makes the code more readable and maintainable. 

The constructor of `TriangleRenderer` takes the parameters that do not change during the rendering of a single triangle (mode, color, pixel, zbuffer, width, and clip) and the `renderFlatTriangle` method of the class takes the positions and depth factors, which do change for each triangle. 

The `assignCoordinates` method in `TriangleRenderer` class is introduced to eliminate the duplication in the initial code. This method is responsible for assigning the coordinates and depth factors to the vertices of the triangle based on their relative positions. 

These changes help in reducing the complexity of the initial method, making the code cleaner and easier to understand. It also makes it easier to add additional rendering methods in the future, as they can be added as methods in the `TriangleRenderer` class.
