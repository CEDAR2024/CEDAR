1. Encapsulation of Row Specification Logic into a Dedicated Class (RowSpecBuilder)
Why: The original method, buildRowSpec, contained a mixture of responsibilities: constructing the row specification, managing the data relationships, and handling specific data formats. This mingling is problematic as it violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which advocates for a class or method to have a single reason to change. The method extensively accessed and manipulated data from another class's fields (name, row, familyMap, etc.), showing high dependency and interest in the data structure of another class.

How it helps: By moving the logic to a dedicated class, each class now has a more focused role. RowSpecBuilder solely manages building the row specification string based on given parameters, which makes it easier to understand and modify. The separation of concerns achieved here means changes in how row specifications are built (perhaps different formatting or inclusion of new parameters) are localized to this new class without affecting other parts of the system.

2. Detailed Methods for Each Part of the Specification (appendFamilies, appendTimeRange, appendMaxVersions)
Why: In the original code, the logic for appending families, time ranges, and maximum versions were interleaved in a single method. This made the method long, complex, and harder to maintain. Each time a new formatting rule or condition needed to be added, the risk of inadvertently affecting other unrelated parts was high.

How it helps: Each method now handles a specific part of building the row specification string. This makes the code more modular and reusable. For instance, if the format for time range changes, only appendTimeRange needs to be updated. This modularity also enhances testing ease, as each component can be independently verified.

3. Parameterization and Dependency Injection in Constructor
Why: The initial setup for building the string pulled in various external dependencies directly within the method (like familyMap, name, etc.). This tight coupling made it hard to manage dependencies and unit test the method, as it was dependent on the specific environment setup.

How it helps: By passing necessary components such as name, row, familyMap, etc., as parameters to the constructor of RowSpecBuilder, it allows for better control over the dependencies and makes the class easier to test. Dependency injection also enhances flexibility, as different parts of the application can reuse this builder with different configurations.

4. Clear Usage Context Separation
Why: The original method was a mixture of utility operations (like constructing the string) and application-specific logic (like accessing tokens and names).

How it helps: In the refactored code, the application-specific logic (like retrieving the access token or name) is separated from the utility logic of building the row spec string. This separation not only simplifies the RowSpecBuilder class but also clarifies where and how specific data is used, aligning with the principle of least knowledge (Law of Demeter), which discourages strong coupling between components.
