Encapsulating State Management in a Single Class:

Why: The original method processRegionsInTransition had too many responsibilities. It directly manipulated the regionsInTransition map and performed checks and operations specific to different region states.
How it helps: By introducing the RegionTransitionProcessor, all logic related to the management of region states is encapsulated within a single class. This not only organizes the code better but also aligns the operations with the data they primarily interact with (i.e., region states and transition data). This design reduces the Feature Envy smell, where methods in one class extensively manipulate data in another class.
Method Extraction for Specific State Processing:

Why: The switch-case statements in the original code were cumbersome and made the method lengthy and hard to maintain. Each case dealt with different region states but was all mashed together in one function.
How it helps: By extracting these cases into their own methods within RegionTransitionProcessor, each state handling logic is isolated. This makes the code easier to understand, modify, and test. Methods that need to access and modify the state information are now placed in the same class where the state is managed, thus adhering more closely to object-oriented principles and reducing Feature Envy.
Centralizing Shared Resources and Dependencies:

Why: The original function had implicit dependencies on multiple external resources, like serverManager and deadServers, which it used directly to make decisions.
How it helps: By passing these dependencies to the constructor of RegionTransitionProcessor, these are centralized within the class. This means less coupling between the processRegionsInTransition function and the external data, leading to a cleaner, more modular design where RegionTransitionProcessor manages all interactions with these resources.
Synchronization Managed Internally:

Why: In the original code, synchronization was managed externally around the switch-case logic.
How it helps: By moving synchronization inside the processRegion method, it encapsulates the thread safety concerns within the RegionTransitionProcessor. This reduces the responsibility of external code to manage the internal state of region transitions, further encapsulating functionality and reducing the risk of threading issues made by external manipulations.
Improving Logistical and Error Handling Flow:

Why: The initial setup checks and the removal of the region from hris were dispersed throughout the broader function.
How it helps: Keeping these initial checks and setups outside the processor class (still within processRegionsInTransition) ensures that the processor is only concerned with the state transition logic, not preliminary data setups. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to follow and maintain.
