The original `createOutlineAction` function was performing multiple tasks, including creating different types of actions based on the action type. This not only made the function overly long and complicated but also led to the Feature Envy code smell because the function was excessively interacting with the `map` object's data. 

To address these issues, the refactoring process involved the following changes:

1. **Introduction of the `ActionCreator` class**: This new class encapsulates the action creation logic. It's initialized with a `PdfWriter` instance, which is required for creating some types of actions. Encapsulating the action creation logic within a class helps to organize the code better and reduces the Feature Envy smell as the behavior is now associated with the data it operates upon.

2. **Division of the original function into smaller methods**: The `createAction` method in the `ActionCreator` class delegates the action creation to the corresponding method based on the action type. Each specific action creation method, such as `createGoToAction`, `createGoToRAction`, `createURIAction`, and `createLaunchAction`, handles the creation of a specific type of action. This division enhances the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) -- each function now has a single, clear purpose. It also improves readability and maintainability, as each function is shorter and simpler, and changes to one type of action won't affect the others.

3. **Reduced interaction with the `map` object**: By moving the action creation logic into the `ActionCreator` class and its methods, the interaction with the `map` object is localized within each specific action creation method. This reduces the Feature Envy smell, as now each method only interacts with the data it needs to create a specific type of action.

These changes result in a design that's more object-oriented, with behavior more closely associated with the data it operates upon, and a clearer, more maintainable structure.
