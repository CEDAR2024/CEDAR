The refactoring process addressed the "God Class" code smell by breaking down the monolithic `JavaLexer` class into smaller, more focused classes. Each class now has a distinct responsibility, making the entire system easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Here's a detailed explanation of why each change was made and how it helps address the code smell:

### 1. **Introduction of `BaseLexer` Class**
- **Why?** The `BaseLexer` class serves as a foundational class that provides common functionality required by all specific lexer components, such as handling the input state and common lexer operations. This avoids code duplication across the different handler classes.
- **Benefits:** It promotes code reuse and ensures that changes to common functionality need to be made in only one place, making maintenance easier.

### 2. **Creation of Specialized Handler Classes**
- **Why?** The original `JavaLexer` class was responsible for parsing everything from literals and identifiers to whitespace and comments. By creating specialized handler classes (`LiteralHandler`, `NumberHandler`, `IdentifierHandler`, `WhitespaceAndCommentHandler`, `OperatorHandler`), the responsibilities are divided logically among smaller units.
- **Benefits:** This separation makes the codebase more modular, allowing developers to easily locate, understand, and modify the code responsible for a specific part of the lexical analysis. It also facilitates unit testing of individual components.

### 3. **Decoupling of Concerns**
- **Why?** The `JavaLexer` class was tightly coupled with all aspects of lexical analysis, making it difficult to modify one part without affecting others. By decoupling these concerns into separate classes, each class becomes more focused and independent.
- **Benefits:** This approach enhances the readability and maintainability of the code. It allows for independent development and testing of features, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.

### 4. **Hashtable for Literals in `IdentifierHandler`**
- **Why?** The handling of literals was embedded within the main lexer logic, complicating the method responsible for identifying tokens. By moving this responsibility to the `IdentifierHandler`, which now also manages a hashtable for literals, the handling of keywords and identifiers is centralized and abstracted away from the main lexer logic.
- **Benefits:** This makes it easier to update and manage the set of keywords and literals without touching the core parsing logic. It also encapsulates the logic for distinguishing between keywords and identifiers in one place.

### 5. **Main Class as Coordinator**
- **Why?** The refactored `JavaLexer` class now acts as a coordinator that composes the specialized handler classes. Instead of directly implementing all parsing logic, it delegates to the appropriate handlers based on the context of the input.
- **Benefits:** This design follows the principle of "composition over inheritance," making the system more flexible and adaptable to changes. It simplifies the `JavaLexer` class, making it easier to understand the high-level flow of lexical analysis without getting bogged down in details.

### Overall Impact on Addressing the Code Smell
The "God Class" code smell indicates a class that has taken on too many responsibilities, making it overly complex and challenging to maintain. By applying the changes mentioned above, the refactored code:

- **Improves Readability:** Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand than a single, large class.
- **Enhances Maintainability:** Changes can be made more confidently and with a lower risk of unintended side effects.
- **Facilitates Extensibility:** Adding new functionality or modifying existing behavior becomes easier when the system is modular.
- **Promotes Testability:** Independent units can be tested in isolation, improving the reliability of the code.

These improvements directly address the drawbacks of having a "God Class" and contribute to a healthier, more sustainable codebase.
