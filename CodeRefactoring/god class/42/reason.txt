The refactoring changes made to the `SchemaManager` class address the code smell known as "God Class." Here's an explanation of why each change was made and how it helps address this code smell:

1. **Extraction of Responsibilities**: 
   - **Why**: The `SchemaManager` class had too many responsibilities, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The class was responsible for creating, dropping, and managing schema objects, among other things.
   - **How it helps**: By extracting specific responsibilities into separate classes (`SchemaCreator` for creating schemas and `SchemaDropper` for dropping schemas), the `SchemaManager` class becomes more focused and easier to manage. Each class now has a single responsibility, improving readability and maintainability.

2. **Encapsulation of Related Data and Behavior**:
   - **Why**: The original `SchemaManager` class contained methods that operated on schema-related data. These methods were closely related and shared common data, but they were not grouped together in a meaningful way.
   - **How it helps**: By grouping methods and the data they operate on into separate classes, we encapsulate the behavior related to schema creation and dropping. This encapsulation makes the codebase more modular and easier to understand.

3. **Improved Code Organization**:
   - **Why**: The original `SchemaManager` class was large and unwieldy, with many methods that made it hard to find specific functionality.
   - **How it helps**: The new classes provide a logical organization of methods. For example, all methods related to creating a schema are now in the `SchemaCreator` class. This organization makes it easier for developers to locate and work with the relevant code.

4. **Delegation of Responsibilities**:
   - **Why**: The original `SchemaManager` class directly implemented all the functionality for managing schemas.
   - **How it helps**: With the new classes, the `SchemaManager` delegates the responsibilities of creating and dropping schemas. This delegation follows the principle of "composition over inheritance," allowing for more flexible and reusable code.

5. **Simplification of the `SchemaManager` Interface**:
   - **Why**: The `SchemaManager` class had a complex interface with many methods that could be confusing to use.
   - **How it helps**: The refactored `SchemaManager` now has a simplified interface. It interacts with the `SchemaCreator` and `SchemaDropper` classes through their own interfaces, reducing the complexity of the `SchemaManager` class itself.

6. **Ease of Testing**:
   - **Why**: The original `SchemaManager` class was difficult to test due to its many intertwined responsibilities.
   - **How it helps**: The new classes can be tested independently of the `SchemaManager`, making it easier to write unit tests. This separation allows for more focused tests that cover specific aspects of schema management.

By addressing the "God Class" code smell through these changes, the `SchemaManager` class becomes more maintainable, understandable, and testable. It adheres better to the Single Responsibility Principle, one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, which states that a class should have only one reason to change.
