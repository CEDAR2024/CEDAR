The refactoring addresses the God Class code smell by applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Separation of Concerns (SoC). Here's how each change helps:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - By creating separate classes like `SchemaOperations`, `TableOperations`, `SequenceOperations`, etc., each class is now responsible for a single aspect of schema management. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain, as each class has a clear and concise role.

2. **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
   - The `SchemaManager` class originally contained methods that dealt with a wide range of concerns, from creating schemas to managing tables, sequences, and more. By separating these concerns into individual classes, each concern can be developed, tested, and modified independently of the others.

3. **Improved Readability:**
   - The original `SchemaManager` class was large and unwieldy, making it difficult to read and understand. The new structure, with multiple smaller classes, makes it easier to locate the methods responsible for specific functionality.

4. **Enhanced Maintainability:**
   - Changes to one area of schema management are now localized to a single class. This isolation reduces the risk of introducing bugs into unrelated areas of the code when making modifications.

5. **Easier Testing:**
   - Smaller classes with focused responsibilities are easier to test. Unit tests can be written to target specific functionality without the need for understanding the entire schema management system.

6. **Reusability:**
   - With functionality broken down into smaller classes, there's a higher chance that some of these classes can be reused in different contexts without modification.

7. **Easier Debugging:**
   - If a bug arises in a specific area, such as table management, developers can focus their attention on the `TableOperations` class, rather than sifting through a massive `SchemaManager` class.

8. **Scalability:**
   - As the application grows and new features are added, having a well-organized codebase with a clear structure makes it easier to scale. New functionality can be added as new classes, rather than bloating existing classes.

9. **Reduced Complexity:**
   - Each class now encapsulates the data and methods relevant to one aspect of schema management, reducing the complexity of each class and making the system as a whole easier to comprehend.

10. **Collaboration:**
    - In a team environment, it's easier to assign development work on different parts of the schema management system to different developers or teams without them stepping on each other's toes.

The refactoring process does not necessarily improve the performance of the code, but it significantly improves the quality of the codebase from a software engineering perspective. The goal is to make the code more maintainable, readable, and less prone to errors, which in the long run can lead to a more robust and flexible application.
