The original `RegularExpression` class exhibited classic signs of a "God class" code smell, where a single class takes on too many responsibilities, becoming large, complex, and difficult to maintain. To address this code smell, we applied several refactoring techniques that help improve the separation of concerns and make the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. Here's why each change was made:

1. **Extract Classes (`TokenCompiler` and `Matcher`):**
   - **Why:** The `RegularExpression` class was handling both the compilation of the token tree into an operation flow and the matching logic. These are distinct responsibilities that can be encapsulated in separate classes.
   - **How it helps:** By moving the compilation logic into `TokenCompiler` and the matching logic into `Matcher`, we give each class a single responsibility. This not only makes the classes easier to understand and test but also simplifies the `RegularExpression` class.

2. **Delegate Matching Methods to `Matcher`:**
   - **Why:** The `RegularExpression` class contained several overloaded `matches` methods and complex matching logic intermingled with context management.
   - **How it helps:** By delegating the matching logic to the `Matcher` class, we isolate the matching process from the setup and teardown of the matching context. This allows the `RegularExpression` class to focus on providing a clean API for users, while `Matcher` handles the intricacies of executing the match.

3. **Context Management Methods (`obtainContext` and `releaseContext`):**
   - **Why:** The original code directly manipulated the `Context` object, creating and resetting it within the `matches` methods.
   - **How it helps:** Introducing `obtainContext` and `releaseContext` methods abstracts the context lifecycle management. This makes the `matches` methods cleaner and opens up possibilities for context pooling or other optimizations without changing the matching logic.

4. **Move Utility Methods to Appropriate Classes:**
   - **Why:** The `RegularExpression` class contained various static utility methods that were used within the matching logic, such as `isEOLChar` and `getWordType0`.
   - **How it helps:** By moving these utility methods to the `Matcher` class, we keep related logic together and avoid cluttering the `RegularExpression` class with details that are not relevant to its primary role of representing a compiled regular expression.

5. **Preserve Original Class API:**
   - **Why:** The public API methods of the `RegularExpression` class, such as `getPattern`, `getOptions`, and `getNumberOfGroups`, provide important functionality to users of the class.
   - **How it helps:** Keeping these methods in the `RegularExpression` class ensures that the refactoring does not break existing client code. It also maintains a clear separation between the public interface of the regular expression and the internal implementation details.

Each of these changes contributes to reducing the complexity of the `RegularExpression` class, distributing responsibilities across smaller, focused classes, and improving the overall design of the code. This refactoring makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain the regular expression functionality.
