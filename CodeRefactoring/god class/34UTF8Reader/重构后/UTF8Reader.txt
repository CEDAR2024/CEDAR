The refactoring was guided by the principles of object-oriented design, particularly the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a class should have only one reason to change. By applying SRP and other principles, we address the "God Class" code smell in the following ways:

1. **UTF8DataChunkManager**: The original `UTF8Reader` class was responsible for managing the chunks of data as it reads from the input stream. By extracting this responsibility into a separate `UTF8DataChunkManager`, we isolate the logic for managing data chunks, making it easier to understand, maintain, and potentially reuse. This change reduces the complexity of the `UTF8Reader` and the new class by giving each a single concern.

2. **CharacterProperties**: Character property checks were scattered throughout the `UTF8Reader`. By moving them to a dedicated `CharacterProperties` class, we centralize all character-related operations. This not only cleans up the `UTF8Reader` but also provides a single location where character properties can be managed and updated, following the Open/Closed Principle (classes should be open for extension but closed for modification).

3. **EntityReferenceHandler**: Handling entity references is a distinct task that doesn't need to be mixed with stream reading. By creating a separate handler, we follow SRP and improve testability. The `EntityReferenceHandler` can now be developed and tested independently from the stream reading logic.

4. **CharDataHandler**: This class takes over the responsibility of processing character data. This separation allows `UTF8Reader` to focus on reading data, while `CharDataHandler` focuses on what to do with that data. This clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to understand and adapt.

5. **ContentScanner**: Scanning content for markup and references is a complex task. By moving this logic into `ContentScanner`, we encapsulate all the scanning logic in one place, which simplifies the `UTF8Reader` and allows the `ContentScanner` to be more easily extended and maintained.

6. **NameTokenScanner**: The logic for scanning names and tokens is another distinct operation that deserves its own class. This change allows for focused unit testing and simplifies modifications related to token scanning without affecting other parts of the system.

7. **InputStreamProcessor**: Input stream operations are a low-level concern that should not be mixed with higher-level XML parsing logic. By extracting these operations into `InputStreamProcessor`, we encapsulate all I/O logic, making it reusable and more manageable.

Each change made to refactor the "God Class" anti-pattern aims to create a more maintainable, readable, and testable codebase. Smaller classes with well-defined responsibilities are easier to comprehend individually. They can be modified with less risk of unintended side effects, making the system more robust and adaptable to change. This refactoring also enhances the ability to write unit tests for each class in isolation, which improves the overall quality and reliability of the software.
