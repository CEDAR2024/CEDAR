The refactoring strategy applied to the `SqlFile` class primarily addresses the "God Class" code smell. A God Class is a class that has accumulated too many responsibilities, directly managing numerous details of data processing, business logic, and more. Such a class is problematic because it:

1. **Reduces maintainability**: Changes in one part of the class can have unexpected effects on other parts.
2. **Complicates understanding**: New developers or even the original developers over time may find it hard to understand and remember what the class does.
3. **Hinders reusability**: It's hard to reuse specific behaviors of the class in other contexts without dragging in unrelated functionality.

Here's how each change helps address these issues:

### 1. **DsvImportHandler and DsvExportHandler**
- **Purpose**: Handle all logic related to importing and exporting Delimited Separated Values (DSV) files.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Encapsulation**: By moving DSV-related operations into their own classes, the `SqlFile` class's code becomes shorter and focused on more general SQL file handling tasks.
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each handler focuses on either import or export, making them easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Reusability**: The import and export functionalities can be reused independently in other contexts or projects.

### 2. **SqlExecutor**
- **Purpose**: Execute SQL commands.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Isolation of SQL execution**: Centralizes SQL execution logic, making it easier to handle all SQL-related exceptions, logging, and performance measurements in one place.
  - **Improved Testability**: With SQL execution isolated, it's easier to mock database connections and test the SQL execution logic independently.

### 3. **MacroHandler**
- **Purpose**: Manage macros defined by the user.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Manageability**: Macros are handled in a dedicated class, simplifying management tasks like adding, removing, or executing macros.
  - **Clarity**: Separates macro processing from other unrelated functionalities, clarifying the system's overall structure.

### 4. **HistoryHandler**
- **Purpose**: Manage command history.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Focused History Management**: This handler takes care of storing and retrieving command history, a feature that can grow complex if commands need to be serialized or interacted with in advanced ways.

### 5. **ConnectionHandler**
- **Purpose**: Manage database connections, including transactions.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Centralized Connection Management**: Centralizes checks and operations on the database connection, such as commit/rollback, connection closing, and reconnection logic.

### 6. **FileHandler**
- **Purpose**: Handle file operations like reading from or writing to files.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Decoupling File Operations**: Decouples file I/O from SQL and DSV handling logic, simplifying error handling and path resolution.

### 7. **OutputHandler and InputHandler**
- **Purpose**: Manage input from and output to different sources and destinations.
- **Benefits**:
  - **Streamlined Input/Output**: By managing all output and input through these handlers, it's easier to implement consistent formatting, logging, and error handling.

By breaking down the `SqlFile` class into these focused components, the system becomes more modular, each class becomes easier to manage, and the overall architecture becomes more robust against changes and errors. This approach significantly enhances the maintainability and scalability of the code.
