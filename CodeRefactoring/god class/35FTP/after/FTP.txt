The original `FTP` class exhibited the God Class code smell, characterized by a single class taking on too many responsibilities. This not only makes the class difficult to understand and maintain but also hinders modularity and the ability to reuse parts of the code. The refactoring aimed to address these issues by decomposing the `FTP` class into smaller, more focused classes, each with a clear responsibility. Here’s how each change helps address the code smell:

1. **Introduction of `FTPConnectionDetails`**:
    - **Why**: The original `FTP` class was managing connection details alongside performing FTP operations. This mixed the concerns of connection configuration with file and directory operations.
    - **Benefit**: By extracting connection details into a separate class, we isolate the concern of managing connection configurations. This makes the code more modular, easier to read, and simplifies the main FTP class.

2. **Creation of `FTPFileOperations` and `FTPDirectoryOperations`**:
    - **Why**: The `FTP` class was overloaded with methods for file transfers, directory manipulations, and even permission changes. This complexity made the class hard to navigate and extend.
    - **Benefit**: Separating file and directory operations into their own classes reduces complexity in the main class and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). It becomes easier to modify file operations without risking unintended side effects on directory operations, and vice versa.

3. **Establishing `FTPTransferManager`**:
    - **Why**: The main `FTP` class was directly handling the logic to perform transfers based on action types, which added to its responsibilities and made the execute method overly complex.
    - **Benefit**: The `FTPTransferManager` acts as a coordinator that uses `FTPFileOperations` and `FTPDirectoryOperations` based on the transfer needs. This not only simplifies the main `FTP` class but also centralizes the decision-making logic for transfers, making it easier to manage and update transfer logic in the future.

4. **Refactoring the Main `FTP` Class**:
    - **Why**: The main class was initially responsible for too many tasks, including managing FTP connections, handling file and directory operations, and parsing task configurations.
    - **Benefit**: After refactoring, the main class focuses on task configuration and delegates the actual FTP operations to specialized classes. This improves readability and maintainability, as the class now serves as a clear entry point that sets up configurations and delegates work to more specialized components.

5. **General Benefits**:
    - **Modularity**: The refactoring promotes modularity, making it easier to reuse, extend, or replace components of the FTP functionality.
    - **Maintainability**: With responsibilities clearly separated, understanding, maintaining, and updating the code becomes more straightforward.
    - **Testability**: Smaller classes with focused responsibilities are easier to unit test, leading to more robust code.

Overall, these changes address the God Class code smell by breaking down a monolithic class into a coherent set of smaller classes, each with a well-defined responsibility. This enhances the code’s readability, maintainability, and scalability, making future development and debugging efforts much more manageable.
