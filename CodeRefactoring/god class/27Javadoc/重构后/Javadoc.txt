The refactoring addresses the "God Class" code smell by applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that each class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software. Here's how each change helps address the code smell:

1. **DocletConfig**: The original `Javadoc` class was responsible for managing doclet parameters among many other things. By extracting these responsibilities into `DocletConfig`, we localize all doclet-related configuration in one place. This makes the code easier to maintain and the `Javadoc` class less complex.

2. **JavadocArguments**: The `Javadoc` class was also managing command line arguments. `JavadocArguments` takes over this responsibility, encapsulating the logic for building the command line for the Javadoc tool. This separation allows for easier updates and testing of command line argument handling.

3. **SourcePathConfig**: Source path configuration is another distinct area of functionality that was embedded in the `Javadoc` class. `SourcePathConfig` now manages the source paths independently, making the logic reusable and the `Javadoc` class simpler.

4. **PackageAndSourceFiles**: The handling of packages and source files for Javadoc documentation was intertwined with other concerns. By moving this to `PackageAndSourceFiles`, we create a focused and coherent class that deals only with identifying which packages and source files need documentation.

5. **ExternalFileConfig**: The decision of whether to use an external file for Javadoc arguments is now encapsulated within `ExternalFileConfig`. This change improves the modularity of the code and isolates the external file configuration from the rest of the Javadoc logic.

6. **ClasspathConfig**: Classpath management is a separate concern that has been moved into its own class, `ClasspathConfig`. This allows for a clear interface for classpath-related actions and simplifies the `Javadoc` class by removing another responsibility.

7. **JavadocExecutor**: The execution of the Javadoc command is a distinct operation that has been encapsulated in `JavadocExecutor`. This class is now in charge of running the Javadoc tool with the provided arguments, which separates the execution concern from the preparation of Javadoc settings.

By applying these changes, the refactored code improves maintainability, readability, and testability. Each class is now easier to understand and modify independently, and changes in one class are less likely to affect others. This approach also makes it easier to track down bugs because the code related to a specific functionality is localized within a single class.

Overall, the refactoring addresses the "God Class" code smell by creating a more organized structure where each class has a clear and single responsibility.
