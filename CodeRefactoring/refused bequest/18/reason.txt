Explanation of changes:

Create StimulusActionHandler class

Why: Encapsulate specific functionality in a separate class.
How to: Move methods related to GoStimulusToAction-specific functionality into StimulusActionHandler.
Benefits: Separate concerns, enhance modularity, and reduce the burden of GoStimulusToAction.
Remove the inheritance relationship of AbstractPerspectiveRule

Why: GoStimulusToAction does not fully utilize inherited methods and properties.
How to: Change GoStimulusToAction to use composition mode, handling specific functionality via StimulusActionHandler.
Benefits: Avoid unnecessary inheritance and make the code easier to understand and maintain.
Encapsulate specific methods in StimulusActionHandler

Why: Make GoStimulusToAction more focused on its core responsibilities.
How to: Move methods like getChildren, getDependencies, and getRuleName into StimulusActionHandler.
Benefit: Improves readability and maintainability by clearly separating different concerns.
These changes help resolve the "Refused Bequest" code smell, because GoStimulusToAction no longer inherits unnecessary methods and properties, but uses StimulusActionHandler in combination to complete the required functionality. This makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
