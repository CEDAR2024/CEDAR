Explanation of Changes and Benefits
Creation of StateInternalTransHandler class:

Change: Encapsulated methods getRuleName, getChildren, and getDependencies into StateInternalTransHandler.
Benefit: This separates the specific logic related to GoStateToInternalTrans into its own class, enhancing modularity and readability.
Removal of inheritance from AbstractPerspectiveRule:

Change: The GoStateToInternalTrans class no longer extends AbstractPerspectiveRule.
Benefit: Since GoStateToInternalTrans uses only a subset of methods and properties from AbstractPerspectiveRule, removing inheritance avoids the Refused Bequest smell. It makes clear that GoStateToInternalTrans does not need to inherit unnecessary methods, simplifying the class hierarchy.
Use of composition in GoStateToInternalTrans:

Change: Introduced a StateInternalTransHandler object in GoStateToInternalTrans.
Benefit: Composition over inheritance ensures that GoStateToInternalTrans uses only the functionalities it needs from StateInternalTransHandler. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable code.
Overall, these changes address the Refused Bequest smell by ensuring GoStateToInternalTrans only utilizes relevant methods without inheriting unnecessary ones. This makes the codebase more modular, easier to understand, and maintain.
