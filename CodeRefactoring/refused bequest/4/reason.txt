Certainly! The refactoring changes I made address the Refused Bequest code smell by transforming the relationship between the `GoTransitionToTarget` class and the `AbstractPerspectiveRule` from inheritance to composition. Hereâ€™s why each change was made and how it helps:

### 1. Removal of Inheritance
**Original**: `GoTransitionToTarget extends AbstractPerspectiveRule`
**Change**: `GoTransitionToTarget` no longer extends `AbstractPerspectiveRule`
**Why**: The key symptom of the Refused Bequest smell is that a subclass does not use much of the functionality provided by its superclass. By inheriting from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, `GoTransitionToTarget` was also inheriting methods and properties it did not use. Removing the inheritance indicates that `GoTransitionToTarget` does not fundamentally represent a type of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`.

### 2. Introduction of Composition
**Original**: Inherited methods and properties from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`
**Change**: Introduced a private `perspectiveRule` variable of type `AbstractPerspectiveRule` inside `GoTransitionToTarget`
**Why**: By using composition (a "has-a" relationship) instead of inheritance (an "is-a" relationship), `GoTransitionToTarget` can still utilize necessary functionalities of `AbstractPerspectiveRule` without being forced to inherit everything. This approach reduces the coupling between the classes, making `GoTransitionToTarget` more independent and focused in its functionality.

### 3. Modified Constructor
**Original**: No specific constructor logic because of direct inheritance
**Change**: Added a constructor in `GoTransitionToTarget` that initializes `perspectiveRule`
**Why**: With composition, you need to ensure that the composed object is properly instantiated. The constructor explicitly creates a new instance of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, which `GoTransitionToTarget` can use to delegate responsibilities that fit within the `AbstractPerspectiveRule` domain.

### Benefits of These Changes
- **Reduced Complexity**: The class now only includes what it needs, reducing complexity and improving understandability.
- **Increased Modularity**: Each class has a more defined and narrower responsibility, enhancing modularity.
- **Improved Maintainability**: Future changes to `AbstractPerspectiveRule` are less likely to inadvertently affect `GoTransitionToTarget` since the latter no longer depends on the former through inheritance.
- **Flexibility in Functionality Usage**: `GoTransitionToTarget` can choose which functionalities of `AbstractPerspectiveRule` to use and when to use them, offering greater flexibility.

These changes effectively address the Refused Bequest by removing unnecessary inheritance and emphasizing the use of composition to achieve a more suitable and maintainable object-oriented design.
