In the refactored version of the `UMLUseCaseDiagram` class, several changes were made to address the Refused Bequest code smell and improve the overall architecture of the code. Here's a breakdown of each change and how it helps:

1. **Separation of Actions into `DiagramActions`**:
    - **Change**: Actions related to the diagram's functionality (like creating nodes and edges) were extracted into a new class, `DiagramActions`.
    - **Reason**: The `UMLUseCaseDiagram` class inherited from `UMLDiagram` but added many specific actions that cluttered the class and made it hard to see how it was using inherited features. This extraction makes the subclass (`UMLUseCaseDiagram`) leaner and focused more on overriding or utilizing the inherited features properly.
    - **Benefit**: This modular approach enhances maintainability and readability. By isolating action management into a separate class, `UMLUseCaseDiagram` becomes more cohesive and adheres better to the Single Responsibility Principle. It also ensures that the class only refines or extends functionalities related to its direct responsibilities.

2. **Initialization of Diagram in Constructor**:
    - **Change**: Moved the initialization logic, such as setting the namespace and configuring the graph model and layers, directly into the constructor.
    - **Reason**: Originally, the class might have scattered initialization logic that could be invoked from outside, potentially misusing the inheritance by bypassing necessary setups.
    - **Benefit**: Centralizing initialization ensures that the diagram is always correctly set up when an instance is created, reducing the risk of errors or misconfigurations. This use of constructors for setup respects the construction mechanisms of the superclass, ensuring that all inherited methods that rely on these properties being set can function correctly.

3. **Direct Use of Inheritance in Method Definitions**:
    - **Change**: Methods like `initializeDiagram` directly utilize methods from the superclass (`setGraphModel`, `setLayer`).
    - **Reason**: To reinforce the use of inherited functionality, making sure that the subclass is building on the base class capabilities rather than bypassing or duplicating them.
    - **Benefit**: This approach leverages polymorphism and ensures that enhancements or changes in the superclass will propagate correctly to subclasses. It also clearly shows the subclass extending the base class functionality in ways that are specific to its purpose.

4. **Encapsulation of Action Initialization**:
    - **Change**: Detailed action setup (like creating specific actions for actors, use cases, etc.) is handled within the `DiagramActions` class rather than directly in the diagram class.
    - **Reason**: To declutter the `UMLUseCaseDiagram` class from the specifics of action management and to prevent misuse of inherited methods that are unrelated to action setup.
    - **Benefit**: Improves the separation of concerns, as `DiagramActions` can independently manage all aspects related to actions without interfering with the diagram's core functionalities. This clear separation makes the system easier to debug, extend, and maintain.

By implementing these changes, the refactored code effectively addresses the Refused Bequest smell by ensuring that the subclass enhances or utilizes the inherited methods and properties appropriately, fitting more naturally into the overall class hierarchy and design philosophy.
