The refactoring approach taken addresses the "Refused Bequest" code smell by reducing unnecessary inheritance and reorganizing the responsibilities of classes to better align with their primary functions. Here's a detailed breakdown of each change and how it helps address this code smell:

1. **Introduction of `PropPanelFactory`:**
   - **Change Explained:** A new class, `PropPanelFactory`, was introduced to take over the responsibility of creating and managing property panels (`PropPanel` instances). This class uses a caching mechanism to store and reuse panels, minimizing the overhead of repeatedly creating panels for the same model elements.
   - **Addressing the Code Smell:** In the original `TabProps` class, the inheritance from `AbstractArgoJPanel` brought along UI-related methods and properties that were underutilized because `TabProps` was overloaded with panel management responsibilities. By moving the panel creation and caching to a separate factory class, `TabProps` can now focus on its main role as a UI component, thereby utilizing its superclass's features more appropriately. This adjustment helps ensure that `TabProps` justifies its inheritance by focusing on UI concerns.

2. **Simplification of `setTarget` in `TabProps`:**
   - **Change Explained:** The `setTarget` method in `TabProps` was simplified to only update the internal target state and refresh the UI by showing the appropriate property panel based on the target. The intricate logic of determining which panel to display was moved to the factory.
   - **Addressing the Code Smell:** Previously, `TabProps` was not only managing UI state changes but also directly handling the logic to decide which panel to create based on the target type. This was a clear sign of the class doing more than what its primary role should be, thus not effectively using the UI management features inherited from `AbstractArgoJPanel`. By delegating the responsibility of deciding which panel to create to `PropPanelFactory`, the `TabProps` class now better leverages its superclass's capabilities by focusing on managing the UI transitions and delegating creation details.

3. **Encapsulation and Caching of Panels:**
   - **Change Explained:** The factory class uses a hashmap to cache created panels. When a panel is requested, the factory first checks if it exists in the cache, thus avoiding redundant creation and ensuring efficient reuse of panels.
   - **Addressing the Code Smell:** This encapsulation and caching mechanism removes the need for `TabProps` to handle the storage and retrieval of panels, which is not its core functionality. This separation ensures that the `TabProps` class is not burdened with additional responsibilities that are irrelevant to its main purpose of displaying panels, thereby making better use of inheritance by focusing on UI-related logic and state management.

By implementing these changes, the refactoring specifically targets the "Refused Bequest" smell by ensuring that each class has a well-defined and appropriate role, thus justifying their positions in the inheritance hierarchy. This leads to a more maintainable and understandable codebase, where each class focuses on its strengths and delegates other responsibilities to more specialized classes.
