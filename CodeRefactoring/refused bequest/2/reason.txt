Certainly! Here's a detailed explanation of each change made in the refactoring process and how it addresses the Refused Bequest code smell:

### 1. Creation of `ObjectFlowStateNotationHandler`
**Change**: Introduced a new class `ObjectFlowStateNotationHandler` to handle the parsing logic that was previously within the subclass `ObjectFlowStateStateNotationUml`.
**Reason**: The parsing logic in `ObjectFlowStateStateNotationUml` appeared overly specific and not necessarily suitable for all potential subclasses of `ObjectFlowStateStateNotation`. By moving this specific functionality into a separate handler class, the subclass can now choose to use or not use this handler based on its specific needs.
**Benefit**: This separation of concerns allows the `ObjectFlowStateStateNotationUml` class to remain cleaner and more focused on what it uniquely needs to do, reducing the inheritance of unused or unnecessary functionalities from its parent class.

### 2. Streamlined Parsing Logic
**Change**: Consolidated and streamlined the parsing logic within the `parse` method of the `ObjectFlowStateNotationHandler` class.
**Reason**: The original method was cluttered with details that handled the string manipulation and parsing logic directly intertwined with UI and model manipulation, which made the code hard to read and maintain.
**Benefit**: By separating the concerns and creating a cleaner, more modular parsing function, the code becomes easier to maintain, understand, and potentially reuse.

### 3. Reduction of Duplication
**Change**: Moved redundant checks and operations (like string trimming and bracket removal) to a single location within the parsing logic.
**Reason**: There were repetitive operations scattered across the method that could be centralized for better clarity and efficiency.
**Benefit**: This ensures that the input manipulation is handled in one place, making the code neater and reducing the likelihood of errors if changes are made to this preprocessing step.

### 4. Error Handling
**Change**: Simplified the error handling by catching parsing exceptions and displaying error messages in a more structured manner.
**Reason**: Previously, error handling was mixed directly with business logic, complicating the method structure.
**Benefit**: Centralizing error handling makes the business logic clearer and separation allows easier modifications to error management strategies.

### 5. Use of a Helper Method for State Retrieval
**Change**: Created a helper method `findStateByName` to abstract the details of state retrieval based on a name.
**Reason**: This logic was embedded directly in the parsing process, making the method longer and harder to understand.
**Benefit**: Encapsulating this logic into a separate method simplifies the main parsing logic, promotes reuse of the `findStateByName` functionality, and improves readability.

### 6. Better Abstraction and Encapsulation
**Change**: Ensured that all details about how states are managed and parsed are encapsulated within the `ObjectFlowStateNotationHandler`.
**Reason**: This prevents the subclass from having to deal directly with low-level details of state management.
**Benefit**: Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data and the processes, ensuring that they can only be modified in controlled ways. It also makes the subclass simpler and focused on its specific functionality.

These changes collectively address the Refused Bequest smell by ensuring that the subclass does not inherit unnecessary methods or properties that it does not need or use, and by focusing the subclass on functionality that genuinely enhances or differs from the base class capabilities.
