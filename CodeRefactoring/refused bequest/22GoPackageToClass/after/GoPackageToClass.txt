Let's go through each change one by one to understand why they were made and how they help address the Refused Bequest code smell:

1. **Removal of Inheritance**: 
   - **Why**: The original `GoPackageToClass` class inherited from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, but if it only used some of the inherited methods or none at all, it indicated a Refused Bequest smell. Inheritance should be used when a class wants to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class. If it does not fully utilize the parent class's behavior, inheritance is not justified.
   - **How it helps**: By removing the inheritance and not extending `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, we eliminate the forced contract that `GoPackageToClass` has to fulfill methods it does not need. This makes the class's purpose and usage clearer and reduces the complexity of the class hierarchy.

2. **Introduction of Delegation**:
   - **Why**: Delegation is used to move shared functionality to a separate object. If there is common behavior that multiple classes need, it's better to have it in a single place and use it through composition rather than forcing a class hierarchy.
   - **How it helps**: It addresses the code smell by allowing `GoPackageToClass` to use only the functionality it needs from the delegate. This approach avoids the overhead of unnecessary methods from the parent class and promotes the use of only those methods that are essential for the class's purpose.

3. **Constructor Injection of Delegate**:
   - **Why**: Constructor injection is a form of Dependency Injection that allows a class to be provided with its dependencies (in this case, the delegate) rather than constructing them itself or extending a class to inherit them. This makes dependencies explicit and eases testing and management.
   - **How it helps**: It allows `GoPackageToClass` to be independent of the creation of its delegate, making the class more testable and flexible. By injecting the delegate, we can easily swap out implementations without changing the class itself, which is useful for testing or if the behavior needs to change in the future.

4. **Preservation of Specific Functionality**:
   - **Why**: The `getRuleName` and `getChildren` methods are specific to what `GoPackageToClass` is supposed to do. These methods provide functionality directly related to the class's purpose and are not generic utility methods that can be shared across classes.
   - **How it helps**: Keeping the specific functionality within the class ensures that it remains focused on its role. It also ensures that the class does not have to rely on a parent class for its core functionality, which reduces dependencies and potential issues with changes in the parent class.

5. **Handling Dependencies**:
   - **Why**: The `getDependencies` method is kept but could be refactored further. If it turns out that handling dependencies is a common need across classes, it would make sense to delegate this responsibility as well.
   - **How it helps**: By potentially moving the dependencies handling to a delegate, we further isolate the specific functionality of `GoPackageToClass` from shared concerns. This separation of concerns makes the class easier to understand and maintain.

In summary, these changes help address the Refused Bequest code smell by removing unnecessary inheritance and instead using delegation for shared functionality. This leads to a more maintainable and flexible codebase, where each class has a clear responsibility and is less coupled to its parent classes.
