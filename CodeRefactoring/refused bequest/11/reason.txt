In refactoring the `GoClassifierToSequenceDiagram` class, the changes address the Refused Bequest code smell, ensuring that the subclass properly utilizes and extends the functionality of its parent class, `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. Here's a detailed explanation of each change and how it helps in addressing the code smell:

1. **Rule Name Customization (`getRuleName`)**:
   - **Change**: The method was overridden to return a specific name that accurately represents its function related to sequence diagrams.
   - **Purpose and Benefit**: By providing a specific name, the method clarifies the role of this subclass within the application. This change ensures that the subclass adds specific functionality related to sequence diagrams, which is a form of modifying and enhancing the inherited functionality from the superclass. It thereby fulfills the concept that subclasses should not merely inherit methods without using them or modifying them to add specific value.

2. **Enhanced Child Gathering Logic (`getChildren`)**:
   - **Change**: Overridden to implement a specialized version that filters only sequence diagrams related to the given classifier. It employs Java Stream API for better readability and performance.
   - **Purpose and Benefit**: This method extension directly supports the subclass's specific purpose by focusing on sequence diagrams, which are relevant to the given classifier context. By using Java Streams, the method is not only more readable but also more efficient in handling collections. This is a direct extension and use of the superclass's method tailored to specific needs, thus enhancing the inherited method rather than ignoring it.

3. **Dependency Management (`getDependencies`)**:
   - **Change**: The method now returns an empty set instead of `null`.
   - **Purpose and Benefit**: Returning an empty set instead of `null` improves the reliability and stability of the application by preventing potential `NullPointerExceptions`. This change ensures that any interactions with the method's output can safely assume a non-null result, simplifying client code. Even though this method does not add specific functionality related to sequence diagrams, it enhances general usability and safety, which is a good practice when subclasses override inherited methods.

Overall, these changes enhance the functionality provided by the superclass to make it specific to sequence diagrams, directly addressing the Refused Bequest smell by ensuring that all inherited methods are effectively used or adapted to add specific value. This approach ensures that the subclass is a justified and effective specialization of its parent class.
