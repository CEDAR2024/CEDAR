Sure, here's an explanation for each change made in the refactoring process and how it addresses the Refused Bequest code smell:

1. **Elimination of Inheritance**: The class `GoTransitionToGuard` no longer extends `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. The Refused Bequest smell was present because the subclass was not fully utilizing its parent's methods or properties, indicating that the inheritance relationship was not appropriate. By removing this inheritance, we've addressed this smell directly. Now, `GoTransitionToGuard` is no longer a subclass of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, and there's no concern about it not fully utilizing the methods and properties of its parent class.

2. **Introduction of Delegation**: We introduced a `delegate` of type `PerspectiveRuleDelegate`. The delegate can encapsulate any common behaviors or utilities that the `GoTransitionToGuard` class might need. This approach shifts the design from an inheritance-based one to a composition-based one. Instead of inheriting behaviors and properties from a parent class, `GoTransitionToGuard` now has its own instance of a delegate object that it can use to perform operations. This improves code clarity and maintainability.

3. **Constructor Injection for Delegate**: By allowing the delegate to be passed into the `GoTransitionToGuard` constructor, we've made the class more flexible and easier to test. Different implementations of the delegate can be injected when creating an instance of `GoTransitionToGuard`, allowing the class's behavior to be easily modified or mocked for testing. This change doesn't directly address the Refused Bequest smell, but it contributes to better overall code design and maintainability.

4. **Preservation of Class-Specific Functionality**: We kept methods like `getRuleName`, `getChildren`, and `getDependencies` in the `GoTransitionToGuard` class because they provide functionality specific to the class's role within the application. This ensures that the class maintains its intended functionality and domain-specific logic. By not inheriting these methods from a parent class, `GoTransitionToGuard` ensures that it only contains the methods it needs, further addressing the Refused Bequest smell.

5. **Handling Dependencies**: The `getDependencies` method remains in the class to ensure that any dependencies specific to the transition-to-guard relationship are correctly identified. This keeps the domain logic encapsulated within the class, which is a good practice for maintaining clear, understandable code.

By making these changes, we've transformed the code to better adhere to the principles of composition over inheritance and single responsibility. The code is now more straightforward, easier to maintain, and free of the Refused Bequest smell.
