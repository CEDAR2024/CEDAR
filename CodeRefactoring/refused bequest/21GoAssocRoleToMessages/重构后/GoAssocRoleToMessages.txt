Sure, here's the explanation for each change:

1. **Removed inheritance from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`**: The `GoAssocRoleToMessages` class was initially a subclass of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. However, it was not using all the methods and properties of its parent class, which is the essence of the Refused Bequest code smell. By removing the inheritance, we eliminate the unnecessary coupling between these two classes.

2. **Added `PerspectiveRule` as a delegate**: In some cases, the `GoAssocRoleToMessages` class might still need to use some functionality from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. Instead of inheriting this functionality, we can use composition and delegation. This means we create a `PerspectiveRule` object and use it to handle any functionality that `GoAssocRoleToMessages` needs from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. This way, `GoAssocRoleToMessages` only uses the methods it needs, and we can clearly see this relationship in the code.

3. **Retained `getRuleName`, `getChildren`, and `getDependencies` methods**: These methods are specific to the functionality of `GoAssocRoleToMessages` and are used by this class. Therefore, they are retained in the refactored class. 

These changes help address the Refused Bequest code smell by ensuring that `GoAssocRoleToMessages` only uses the methods it needs, rather than inheriting a bunch of methods from a parent class that it doesn't use. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain, as it's clear what functionality `GoAssocRoleToMessages` depends on. It also reduces the risk of bugs caused by unexpected interactions with unused inherited functionality.
