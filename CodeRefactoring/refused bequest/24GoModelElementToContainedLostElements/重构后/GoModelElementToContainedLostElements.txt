The code smell identified here is Refused Bequest, which occurs when a subclass does not use all of the methods and properties inherited from its parent class. This is an indication that the subclass might not have a "is-a" relationship with the parent class, which is the fundamental principle of inheritance. In this case, the subclass `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` only uses some of the methods from the parent class `AbstractPerspectiveRule`.

To address this code smell, the following changes were made:

1. **Removing Inheritance:** The first step was to remove the inheritance relationship between `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` and `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. This was done by removing the `extends AbstractPerspectiveRule` from the class declaration of `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements`.

2. **Introducing Delegation:** After removing inheritance, we introduced a delegation relationship. A private field `perspectiveDelegate` of type `PerspectiveRule` was added to `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements`. This field is initialized via the constructor, allowing the client to pass in an implementation of `PerspectiveRule` that `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` can delegate to.

3. **Delegating Methods:** Finally, for the method `toString()`, which `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` does not override, we simply delegate this method to the `perspectiveDelegate` object.

The changes help address the code smell in the following ways:

1. **Improving Cohesion:** By removing methods that are not relevant to `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements`, we improve the cohesion of this class. Now, it only contains methods that are relevant to its responsibilities.

2. **Reducing Coupling:** By removing the inheritance relationship, we reduce the coupling between `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` and `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. This makes the code more flexible and easier to change in the future.

3. **Increasing Code Readability:** The refactored code is more readable because it's clear that `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` is not a type of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, and it's clear which methods `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` actually uses.

4. **Preserving Functionality:** By introducing delegation, we ensure that `GoModelElementToContainedLostElements` can still use the functionality provided by `AbstractPerspectiveRule` when needed. This is done without inheriting all the methods and properties of `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, thus preserving the functionality while eliminating the code smell.
