### Original Code Analysis

In the original code, `GoDiagramToEdge` inherits from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, but it only uses a small subset of the inherited methods and properties. This is a classic example of the "Refused Bequest" code smell, which indicates that the subclass should not inherit from the parent class if it does not use most of its inherited behavior.

### Changes Made

1. **Extracted `DiagramEdgeHandler` Class**:
    ```java
    class DiagramEdgeHandler {
        private Diagram diagram;

        public DiagramEdgeHandler(Diagram diagram) {
            this.diagram = diagram;
        }

        public Collection getEdges() {
            return Collections.unmodifiableCollection(diagram.getEdges());
        }

        public Set getDependencies() {
            return Collections.singleton(diagram);
        }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - **Purpose**: This class encapsulates the logic related to managing the edges and dependencies of a `Diagram`.
    - **Reason**: By extracting this functionality, we reduce the responsibility of `GoDiagramToEdge` and make it clearer which operations pertain to diagrams.
    - **Benefit**: It promotes the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), making the code easier to maintain and test.

2. **Refactored `GoDiagramToEdge` Class**:
    ```java
    public class GoDiagramToEdge {
        private DiagramEdgeHandler handler;

        public GoDiagramToEdge(Diagram diagram) {
            this.handler = new DiagramEdgeHandler(diagram);
        }

        public String getRuleName() {
            return Translator.localize("misc.diagram.edge");
        }

        public Collection getChildren(Object parent) {
            if (parent instanceof Diagram) {
                return handler.getEdges();
            }
            return Collections.emptyList();
        }

        public Set getDependencies(Object parent) {
            if (parent instanceof Diagram) {
                return handler.getDependencies();
            }
            return Collections.emptySet();
        }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation**:
    - **Purpose**: This class now delegates the responsibility of managing edges and dependencies to the `DiagramEdgeHandler` class.
    - **Reason**: The primary responsibility of this class is to provide the rule name and handle the relationship between diagrams and edges.
    - **Benefit**:
        - **Eliminates Inheritance**: By not inheriting from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, `GoDiagramToEdge` avoids the "Refused Bequest" smell.
        - **Encapsulation**: Delegating to `DiagramEdgeHandler` ensures that `GoDiagramToEdge` only manages its core functionality without the burden of unused inherited methods.
        - **Clarity**: The class is now more focused and easier to understand, making the codebase more maintainable.

### Addressing the Code Smell

- **Reduced Inheritance**: The refactoring removes unnecessary inheritance. `GoDiagramToEdge` no longer inherits from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`, thus adhering to the principle that classes should only inherit from another class if they use most of its behavior.

- **Improved Readability and Maintainability**: By separating concerns into different classes (`DiagramEdgeHandler` for edge management and `GoDiagramToEdge` for rule handling), the code becomes more modular. This modularity makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain.

- **Adherence to SOLID Principles**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class now has a single responsibility. `DiagramEdgeHandler` manages diagram edges and dependencies, while `GoDiagramToEdge` handles rule definitions.
  - **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its behavior and data, making the system more robust and easier to change.

Overall, these changes improve the design by ensuring each class has a clear and distinct responsibility, reducing coupling and enhancing cohesion.
