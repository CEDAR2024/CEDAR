The changes made to the `UMLClassAttributeListModel` class to refactor it into `ClassAttributeManager` were designed to address the Refused Bequest code smell, and they improve the overall design and clarity of the code in several key ways:

### 1. **Removed Inheritance**
**Original**: `UMLClassAttributeListModel extends UMLModelElementOrderedListModel2`
**Change**: Inheritance was removed, and `ClassAttributeManager` does not extend `UMLModelElementOrderedListModel2`.
**Reason**: The subclass `UMLClassAttributeListModel` seemed to only utilize the list management aspects of its superclass sparingly and in a very specific context (managing attributes of UML classes). This suggests that inheritance was not the most appropriate relationship, as it forced the subclass to inherit behavior and attributes that it did not use or need.

**Benefit**: Removing inheritance and converting the class into a standalone class focused on attribute management makes the class easier to understand and maintain. It reduces complexity by not inheriting unnecessary methods and properties from the superclass, thus aligning the class structure more closely with its specific use case.

### 2. **Focused Class Responsibility**
**Original**: The class mixed UI list model behaviors with attribute management logic.
**Change**: The refactored `ClassAttributeManager` focuses solely on managing attributes without concerning itself with UI list model behaviors.
**Reason**: The original class was tasked with both managing UML class attributes and acting as a model for UI components, which are distinct responsibilities and can lead to a class doing too much (violating the Single Responsibility Principle).

**Benefit**: The new class has a single, clear purpose: managing class attributes. This separation of concerns makes the class more reusable and easier to test since it's no longer tightly coupled to the UI's list model functionality.

### 3. **Method Simplification and Renaming**
**Original**: Methods were designed to integrate tightly with UI list model requirements.
**Change**: Methods have been simplified and renamed to clearly reflect their operations (e.g., `buildAttributeList`, `isValidAttribute`, and `swapAttributes`).
**Reason**: In the original setup, method names and behaviors were influenced by the inherited class, which might not have been intuitive for managing attributes outside of a UI context.

**Benefit**: Clear, descriptive method names improve readability and maintainability. The methods now directly describe what they do, making the class easier to use and understand in different contexts, not just as a UI model.

### 4. **Decoupling from UI Logic**
**Original**: The class was inherently tied to UI behavior.
**Change**: All UI dependencies have been removed.
**Reason**: The class's dependence on UI behavior was a byproduct of the refused bequest since these behaviors were part of the inherited class's design.

**Benefit**: The refactoring makes `ClassAttributeManager` a pure backend logic class, decoupled from any UI logic. This decoupling allows for better testing and reuse in different parts of the application where UI is not involved, increasing the flexibility of the class.

These changes collectively address the Refused Bequest smell by eliminating unnecessary inheritance and refining the class's responsibilities, thus enhancing its coherence, reusability, and ease of maintenance.
