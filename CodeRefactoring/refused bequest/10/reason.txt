The refactoring addresses the Refused Bequest code smell by ensuring that the subclass (`ObjectFlowStateTypeNotationUml`) properly utilizes and extends functionalities from its parent class (`ObjectFlowStateTypeNotation`). Each change was made to emphasize that the subclass is a specialized version of the parent, enhancing or customizing behaviors rather than replacing or ignoring inherited methods. Here's the rationale behind each modification:

1. **Enhanced Use of Inheritance**:
   - **Change**: The `parse` method in the subclass starts by calling `super.parse(text)`.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures that any general parsing logic implemented in the superclass is utilized, maintaining the integrity and functionality of the superclass within the subclass. It demonstrates that the subclass extends the superclass's behavior rather than discarding or duplicating it.

2. **Specialized Behavior**:
   - **Change**: After calling the superclass method, additional UML-specific parsing logic is applied.
   - **Purpose**: This addition illustrates how subclasses should extend or specialize the superclass's behavior. It adheres to the principle that subclasses should only modify aspects of behavior that are specific to their needs.

3. **Encapsulation of UML-Specific Logic**:
   - **Change**: UML-specific behaviors, such as finding classifiers and setting types, are encapsulated into separate methods within the subclass.
   - **Purpose**: Encapsulation enhances the clarity and maintainability of the subclass by isolating its specific behaviors, making the class easier to understand and modify. It also keeps the subclass's unique functionalities distinct from those of the superclass.

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - **Change**: Parsing error handling is refined and encapsulated into a dedicated method.
   - **Purpose**: By improving how errors are handled and separating this concern from the main parsing logic, the code becomes cleaner and easier to manage. This separation also underscores the subclassâ€™s role in extending functionality with additional responsibilities like error messaging specific to its context.

5. **Method Extraction**:
   - **Change**: Common tasks within the UML parsing process are broken out into their own methods, such as `findClassifier`, `setType`, and `throwParseException`.
   - **Purpose**: This division adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle, ensuring that each method has a clear and distinct role. It simplifies both the superclass and subclass by reducing each method's complexity and focusing each on a single aspect of functionality.

Overall, these changes make the subclass a clear extension of the superclass, using inheritance as intended rather than bypassing or undermining the inherited methods. This approach reduces redundancy, enhances code reuse, and maintains a logical hierarchy between classes, directly addressing the Refused Bequest smell by aligning the subclass's functionality with that of its parent.
