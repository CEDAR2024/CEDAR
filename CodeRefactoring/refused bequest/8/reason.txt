In the refactoring process of the `SelectionActionState` class to address the Refused Bequest code smell, several significant modifications were made to streamline its functionality and reduce unnecessary inheritance. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each change and how they help eliminate the code smell:

### 1. **Removed Inheritance**
**Original**: `SelectionActionState extends SelectionNodeClarifiers`
**Change**: The class now stands independently without extending `SelectionNodeClarifiers`.
**Reason**: If `SelectionActionState` was not making significant use of inherited methods or properties, or the inheritance was leading to functionality that is not utilized, it is a sign of the Refused Bequest. Inheriting from `SelectionNodeClarifiers` could have been introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies that are not relevant.
**Benefit**: By removing inheritance, the class becomes simpler and more focused on its specific responsibilities. This cuts down on the overhead of managing inherited methods that are not needed, thus addressing the Refused Bequest by ensuring that the class only contains relevant and fully utilized functionality.

### 2. **Encapsulation and Localized Functionality**
**Original**: Methods were potentially leveraging or required to align with inherited behavior.
**Change**: Core functionalities such as button handling and interactions are now fully encapsulated within the class.
**Reason**: Encapsulating this functionality within the class itself avoids the misuse of inherited methods and allows for more tailored interaction logic specific to `SelectionActionState`.
**Benefit**: This modification leads to better encapsulation and clearer, more maintainable code. It ensures that the class's operations are self-contained, which improves modularity and readability.

### 3. **Utility Methods for Button Handling**
**Change**: Introduced `calculateButtonPosition` and `withinButtonBounds` as new utility methods to manage button positions and interaction checks.
**Reason**: These methods simplify the handling of graphical elements and interaction logic, making these operations more transparent and easier to manage.
**Benefit**: These utility methods make the codebase more robust and maintainable by centralizing common calculations and interactions. They reduce duplication and improve the maintainability of interaction logic.

### 4. **Direct Management of Graphical Properties**
**Change**: Direct manipulation of graphical properties such as visibility flags and painting logic in the `paintButtons` and related methods.
**Reason**: Directly managing these properties within the class enhances control and reduces dependency on the superclass for graphical rendering behaviors.
**Benefit**: Enhances flexibility and control over how graphical elements are rendered and managed. It allows for customization and adjustments without the constraints of the superclass’s implementation specifics.

### 5. **Simplified Interaction Logic**
**Change**: Redefined `hitHandle` to directly incorporate checking logic based on the class's internal state rather than relying on potentially inherited methods.
**Reason**: This adjustment ensures that the interaction logic is explicitly defined as per the specific needs of `SelectionActionState`, enhancing the clarity and reliability of these interactions.
**Benefit**: Increases the accuracy and responsiveness of user interactions by ensuring that the logic directly reflects the intended behavior of the `SelectionActionState` without unnecessary complexity introduced by inherited behaviors.

### Overall Impact
These changes collectively enhance the class's autonomy and relevance by ensuring that every component and method is intentionally tailored to its specific needs. This approach addresses the Refused Bequest by eliminating unnecessary inheritance and focusing the class on directly relevant functionalities, leading to a more coherent, maintainable, and effective implementation.
