Here's why each change was made in the refactoring process, addressing the code smell of Refused Bequest:

### 1. **Removed Inheritance**
**Original**: `public class GoUseCaseToExtensionPoint extends AbstractPerspectiveRule`
**Change**: Removed inheritance from `AbstractPerspectiveRule`.
**Reason**: The subclass `GoUseCaseToExtensionPoint` does not appear to utilize most of the functionality provided by its superclass `AbstractPerspectiveRule`. This indicates a "Refused Bequest" smell because the subclass is not fully utilizing its inheritance, suggesting that the inheritance hierarchy was not justified.

**Benefit**: By removing the inheritance, the class becomes more focused and less coupled to the superclass. This simplifies the design by removing unnecessary dependencies on parent class methods that are not required, improving maintainability and understandability of the code.

### 2. **Renaming Class and Methods**
**Original**: Class and methods designed to function within a perspective rule system.
**Change**: Renamed the class to `UseCaseExtensionPointProvider` and method `getRuleName` to `getName`.
**Reason**: The renaming reflects the purpose of the class more clearly without the constraints or implications of it being a rule as per the original inheritance structure. This aligns the naming with the functional aspect of the class, focusing on providing extension points for use cases.

**Benefit**: Clarifies the role and functionality of the class to future developers and maintainers of the code. The use of clear, descriptive names makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

### 3. **Method Functionalities Kept Intact**
**Original**: Methods `getChildren` and `getDependencies` remained largely unchanged in functionality.
**Change**: Kept the core functionality of these methods intact.
**Reason**: These methods are essential for the operation of the class, as they provide specific functionalities that are directly related to the main purpose of the class, which is dealing with use case to extension point mappings.

**Benefit**: Ensures that while the structural aspect of the class has been simplified by removing inheritance, the core functionalities are preserved, allowing the class to perform its intended tasks without disruption.

### 4. **Reduced Coupling**
**Original**: The class was tightly coupled to the `AbstractPerspectiveRule` superclass.
**Change**: By removing the inheritance and making the class standalone, it reduces its coupling to unnecessary superclass methods.
**Reason**: Reducing coupling enhances the modularity of the code, making it easier to manage, test, and reuse.

**Benefit**: Enhances the robustness and scalability of the code. Less coupling means changes in other parts of the codebase (like changes in the superclass) are less likely to adversely affect this class.

These changes collectively contribute to addressing the "Refused Bequest" smell by eliminating unnecessary inheritance and focusing the class on its primary responsibilities, thus aligning its implementation more closely with its actual usage.
