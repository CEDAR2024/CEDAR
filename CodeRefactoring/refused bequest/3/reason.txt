The refactoring addresses the **Refused Bequest** code smell by ensuring that the subclass `GoClassToAssociatedClass` only overrides the necessary methods from its superclass and uses inheritance appropriately. Here's why each change was made:

1. **Focused Overrides**:
   - The original `GoClassToAssociatedClass` was inheriting from `AbstractPerspectiveRule` but mainly used for the specific functionality of working with classes and their associated classes in a modeling context.
   - I retained the overriding of `getRuleName()`, `getChildren()`, and `getDependencies()` methods. These are specific to the operations this subclass needs to perform, which are different or more specific than what might be in the superclass. This ensures that the subclass is not inheriting any additional behaviors or properties that it does not use.

2. **Simplified `getChildren()` and `getDependencies()`**:
   - These methods are now streamlined to clearly show their specific use cases concerning class objects, improving readability and maintainability.
   - By using ternary operators and `Collections` utilities, the methods are not only shorter but also clearer. This makes it evident at a glance what the expected inputs and outputs are, which is beneficial for both debugging and future modifications.

3. **Return of Empty Collections Instead of Null**:
   - Changed the return values in `getChildren()` and `getDependencies()` to return empty collections instead of `null` when the conditions are not met.
   - Returning `null` can lead to `NullPointerExceptions` in consuming code, which is a common source of bugs in Java applications. By returning empty collections, any iteration over the results of these methods will simply do nothing if there are no items, rather than causing an error. This increases the robustness of the code.

4. **Use of `Collections.singleton()`**:
   - For the `getDependencies()` method, where a single, immutable object set is returned, `Collections.singleton(parent)` is used instead of manually creating a new `HashSet` and adding `parent` to it.
   - This is more memory-efficient and clearer, as it directly communicates that the returned set is explicitly and only containing the single `parent` object.

These changes collectively enhance the clarity, efficiency, and safety of the code, directly addressing potential issues related to the Refused Bequest smell by ensuring that `GoClassToAssociatedClass` only includes necessary functionalities and avoids inheriting unused or irrelevant properties and methods from its parent class.
