The refactoring of the DatabaseInformationMain class was guided by the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), which states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. The changes made help address the "god class" code smell, where a class knows too much or does too much, by breaking down responsibilities into focused classes. Here's an explanation of each change:

Extracting Schema Information to SchemaManager:
Why: Schema-related operations are a distinct area of functionality. By extracting these methods into a dedicated SchemaManager class, we isolate schema management from other unrelated tasks.
Benefit: This change improves modularity and makes the codebase easier to navigate. The SchemaManager class can evolve independently of other parts of the system, and changes to schema handling will not affect unrelated functionality.
Extracting Table Information to TableManager:
Why: Table-related methods form another distinct area of functionality. Extracting these methods into a TableManager class separates concerns, making it clear where to look for table-related operations.
Benefit: This change enhances maintainability. If modifications to table handling are required, they can be made within the TableManager without risking unintended side effects in other parts of the system.
Extracting System Table Cache Management to SystemTableCache:
Why: The management of system table caches, including their initialization and retrieval, is a separate concern that can be encapsulated in its own class.
Benefit: This change increases clarity and testability. The SystemTableCache class can be tested in isolation, and its implementation can be modified without impacting the rest of the system.
Updating DatabaseInformationMain to Delegate Responsibilities:
Why: After extracting the responsibilities into their respective classes, the DatabaseInformationMain class's role becomes that of a coordinator or facade that delegates tasks to the specialized classes.
Benefit: This change simplifies the DatabaseInformationMain class, making it easier to understand and manage. It also follows the principle of composition over inheritance, where DatabaseInformationMain composes its behavior using instances of other classes rather than inheriting from a superclass.
Overall, these changes help address the god class code smell by organizing the code into more manageable, purpose-focused units.
