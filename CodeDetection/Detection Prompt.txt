In computer programming, a code smell is any characteristic in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem. I will now tell you the definitions about â€œRefused Bequest", "God Class" and "Feature Envy". Please read, understand and learn to find the 3 code smells.
Refused Bequest occurs if a subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its parents. This is an indication that the class should not be a subclass of that parent class, since child classes should be adding or modifying functionality.
God Class is a large and unwieldy class that takes on too many responsibilities within an application. It concentrates a multitude of functions, oversees numerous objects, and effectively tries to do everything.
Feature Envy occurs when a method in one class can't seem to keep its eyes off the data of another class. This sneaky behavior hints that there might be a better home for the method, where it fits in more naturally and keeps the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.
I will now give you two pieces of Java code. The first one is a class that may contain some code smells. If this class has a parent class, the second piece of code will be the parent class that may provide some clues for detecting code smells; if not, the second piece of code will be empty. Please read them carefully and tell me all the code smells contained in the first piece of code. Be aware that the second piece of code, if present, is only for reference and should not be directly checked for code smells. If you suspect there are code smells in the first piece of code, you should answer me in this format: [type of code smell]-[method or class name that contains the code smell]-[class name of the class in which the method or class that contains the code smell is located]. If you think there are no code smells in the first piece of code, you should answer me that "No code smells are detected." You should not output any extra content!
